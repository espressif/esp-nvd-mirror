The loop checks if an element is a\nfgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.\n\nHowever, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might\nrace with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This\ncould result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null\n\"func_hash\" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nTo ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops\nprocessed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit\n63a8dfb (\"function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]\")."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b68b2a3fbacc7be720ef589d489bcacdd05c6d38", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d65474033740ded0a4fe9a097fce72328655b41d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
