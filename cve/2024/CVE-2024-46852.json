When using such a mapping to attempt to\nfault past the end of the buffer, the CMA heap fault handler also checks\nthe fault offset against the buffer size, but gets the boundary wrong by\n1. Fix the boundary check so that we don't read off the end of the pages\narray and insert an arbitrary page in the mapping."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84175dc5b2c932266a50c04e5ce342c30f817a2f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e79050882b857c37634baedbdcf7c2047c24cbff", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea5ff5d351b520524019f7ff7f9ce418de2dad87", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb7fc8b65cea22f9038c52398c8b22849e9620ea", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
