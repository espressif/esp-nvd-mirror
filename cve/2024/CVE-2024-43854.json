For PI metadata this is\nlimited to the app tag that isn't used by kernel generated metadata,\nbut for non-PI metadata the entire buffer leaks kernel memory.\n\nFix this by adding the __GFP_ZERO flag to allocations for writes."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23a19655fb56f241e592041156dfb1c6d04da644", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/899ee2c3829c5ac14bfc7d3c4a5846c0b709b78f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d418313bd8f55c079a7da12651951b489a638ac1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebc0e91ba76dc6544fff9f5b66408b1982806a00", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
