The allocated image will then be\npopulated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after\ncommit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im`\nargument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may\ncause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions\nwhen generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds\nissues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\"\naddress during dry run to fix this problem."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e6a1b1b179abb643ec3560c02bc3082bc92285f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f1e16fb1fc9826001c69e0551d51fbbcd2d74e9", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
