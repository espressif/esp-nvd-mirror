The return value of nilfs_last_byte()\nis also of type \"unsigned int\", but it is truncated so as not to exceed\nPAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09d6d05579fd46e61abf6e457bb100ff11f3a9d3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31f7b57a77d4c82a34ddcb6ff35b5aa577ef153e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48eb6e7404948032bbe811c5affbe39f6b316951", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5af8366625182f01f6d8465c9a3210574673af57", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/985ebec4ab0a28bb5910c3b1481a40fbf7f9e61d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3afea07477baccdbdec4483f8d5e59d42a3f67f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3732102a9d638d8627d14fdf7b208462f0520e0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
