This commit replaces the static\narray allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,\nthereby reducing the stack size.\n\nThis change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  in\nscenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is\nfreed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory\nleaks.\n\nFixes the below with gcc W=1:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function \u2018kfd_get_cu_occupancy\u2019:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]\n  322 | }\n      | ^"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d9f07196389f35a3afebcf1a12c1425725caddd", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/922f0e00017b09d9d47e3efac008c8b20ed546a0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
