An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTPS request to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.\r\nNote: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 4.0}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-787"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-meraki-mx-vpn-dos-QTRHzG2", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
