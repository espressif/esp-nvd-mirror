For ADSP2 and\nHalo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is\n4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there\nare enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with\nwmfw_adsp2_sizes.\n\nThis patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each\nof the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked\nseparately before they are used."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3019b86bce16fbb5bc1964f3544d0ce7d0137278", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/49a79f344d0a17c6a5eef53716cc76fcdbfca9ba", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c9877a96e033bf6c6470b3b4f06106d91ace11e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fd035f0810b33c2a8792effdb82bf35920221565", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
