Meaning k = r mod n. The division used \nduring the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two \ndigits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of \nn and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size. \nObserving the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow \nrevealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of \nk. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a \nsignificant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction \nmethods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "facts@wolfssl.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 0.5, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "facts@wolfssl.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-203"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.7.2-stable", "source": "facts@wolfssl.com"}]}}
