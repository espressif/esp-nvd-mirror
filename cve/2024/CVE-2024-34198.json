The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a stack overflow. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/Swind1er/02f6cb414e440c34878f20fef756e286", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
