This can result in transient handles being leaked\nif the device is subsequently closed with no further commands performed.\n\nFix this by flushing the space in the event of command transmission\nfailure."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c9b228938e9266a1065a3f4fe5c99b7235dc439", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f9f72d843c92fb6f4ff7460d774413cde7f254c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82478cb8a23bd4f97935bbe60d64528c6d9918b4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/adf4ce162561222338cf2c9a2caa294527f7f721", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c84ceb546f30432fccea4891163f7050f5bee5dd", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3aaebcbb7c6b403416f442d1de70d437ce313a7", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebc4e1f4492d114f9693950621b3ea42b2f82bec", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
