With\nMAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works, with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45 it fails.  This has\nbeen reported originally in\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320\n\nThe root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take into\naccount properly the (possibly large) shared info size when selecting\nthe ring layout, and will try to fit two packets inside the same 4K\npage even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.\n\nAddress the issue by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8aba27c4a5020abdf60149239198297f88338a8d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ea80ff5d8298356d28077bc30913ed37df65109", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b52bd8bcb9e8ff250c79b44f9af8b15cae8911ab", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
