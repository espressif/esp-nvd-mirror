In manager.c, the functions action_getconfig() and action_getconfigJson() do not process the input file path, resulting in a path traversal vulnerability. In versions without the restrictedFile() function, no processing is done on the input path. In versions with the restrictedFile() function, path traversal is not processed."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/hyp164D1/5d68b9b7a504f1416272a825ce65966a", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/20.5.0/main/manager.c#L3755", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
