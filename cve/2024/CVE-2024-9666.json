The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause a denial of service.\nThe attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.0, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-444"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10175", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10176", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10177", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10178", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9666", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317440", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
