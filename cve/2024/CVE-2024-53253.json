{"cve": {"id": "CVE-2024-53253", "sourceIdentifier": "security-advisories@github.com", "published": "2024-11-22T20:15:09.210", "lastModified": "2024-11-22T20:15:09.210", "vulnStatus": "Received", "descriptions": [{"lang": "en", "value": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Version 24.11.0, and only version 24.11.0, is vulnerable to a scenario where a specific error message generated by the Sentry platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions: An app installation made use of a Search UI component with the `async` flag set to true (default: true); auser types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results; and that third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret. Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. \n\nSentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. For Sentry SaaS users, only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. No abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred.\n\nAs of time of publication, a fix is available for users of Sentry self-hosted in pull request 81038. Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so Sentry self-hosted users will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. Sentry self-hosted users may review `select_requester.py` for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type. Sentry self-hosted users may not install version 24.11.0 and instead wait for the next release. Self-hosted instance that are already running the affected version may consider downgrading to to 24.10.0."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-209"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/79377", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/81038", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-v5h2-q2w4-gpcx", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
