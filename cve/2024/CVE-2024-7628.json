This is due to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their account."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-288"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mstore-api/trunk/controllers/helpers/firebase-phone-auth-helper.php?rev=3110793#L31", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mstore-api/trunk/controllers/helpers/firebase-phone-auth-helper.php?rev=3110793#L35", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mstore-api/trunk/controllers/helpers/firebase-phone-auth-helper.php?rev=3110793#L5", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3134553%40mstore-api&new=3134553%40mstore-api&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d174f856-d94a-42ed-b547-67699e175cd8?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
