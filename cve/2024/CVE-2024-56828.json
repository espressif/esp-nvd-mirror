Based on the code analysis, it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses significant security risks."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://gitee.com/liweiyi/ChestnutCMS", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/Zerone0x00/CVE/blob/main/ChestnutCMS/CVE-2024-56828.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.1000mz.com/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
