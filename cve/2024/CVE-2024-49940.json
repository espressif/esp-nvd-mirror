When\nthe session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel\nrefcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is\nset in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented\nby l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where\nsession->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been\nbumped.\n\nMoving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but\nl2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses\nsession->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to\nl2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.\n\nIf l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for\nl2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a\nsession which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check for\nthis case."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24256415d18695b46da06c93135f5b51c548b950", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7415e60c25a6108cd7955a20b2e66b6251ffe02", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
