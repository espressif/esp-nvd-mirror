An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-epnmpi-sxss-yyf2zkXs", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
