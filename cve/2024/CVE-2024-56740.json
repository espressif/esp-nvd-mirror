This switch back\nto using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this\nissue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3\nserver while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/650703bc4ed3edf841e851c99ab8e7ba9e5262a3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de5dac261eeab99762bbdf7c20cee5d26ef4462e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
