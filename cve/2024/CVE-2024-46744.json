This assigns the corrupted value\n   3875536935 to inode->i_size.\n\n2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns\n   this corrupted value to the length variable, which being a\n   signed int, overflows producing a negative number.\n\n3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that\n   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means\n   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic\nlink size is not larger than expected.\n\n--\n\nV2: fix spelling mistake."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/087f25b2d36adae19951114ffcbb7106ed405ebb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b9451ba6f21478a75288ea3e3fca4be35e2a438", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5c8906de98d0d7ad42ff3edf2cb6cd7e0ea658c4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/810ee43d9cd245d138a2733d87a24858a23f577d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3af7e460a526007e4bed1ce3623274a1a6afe5e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef4e249971eb77ec33d74c5c3de1e2576faf6c90", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f82cb7f24032ed023fc67d26ea9bf322d8431a90", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fac5e82ab1334fc8ed6ff7183702df634bd1d93d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
