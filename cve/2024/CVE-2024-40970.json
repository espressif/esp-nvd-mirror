Since axi_desc_put()\nhandles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a\nkernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).\n\nTo fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure,\nwhere we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in\naxi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.\n\nAdditionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing\nthe transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can\nbe interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled)."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/333e11bf47fa8d477db90e2900b1ed3c9ae9b697", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c3bb96a20cd8db3b8824b2ff08b6cde4505c7e5", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9004784e8d68bcd1ac1376407ba296fa28f04dbe", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd42570018f5962c10f215ad9c21274ed5d3541e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e151ae1ee065cf4b8ce4394ddb9d9c8df6370c66", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
