There's no state to maintain here as overflows\nalways prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire\nthe locks at the end of the loop."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2493904e95ce94bbec819d8f7f03b99976eb25c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2eadeafce2d385b3f6d26a7f31fee5aba2bbbb0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eac2ca2d682f94f46b1973bdf5e77d85d77b8e53", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4ce3b5d26ce149e77e6b8e8f2058aa80e5b034e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
