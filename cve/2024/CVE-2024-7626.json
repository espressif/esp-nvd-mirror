This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.2}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-73"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/delicious-recipes/tags/1.6.7/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php#L260", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/delicious-recipes/tags/1.6.7/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php#L355", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3148996/delicious-recipes/trunk/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3c98bb53-9f7e-4ab3-9676-e3dbfb4a0519?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
