Specifically, both port read\nURBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer\nof the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port\nstructure.\n\nFix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for\nmos7840.\n\nTested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.\n\n[ johan: analyse crash and rewrite commit message; set busy flag on\n         resume; drop bulk-in check; drop unnecessary usb_kill_urb() ]"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1094ed500987e67a9d18b0f95e1812f1cc720856", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/553e67dec846323b5575e78a776cf594c13f98c4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ae6a64f18211851c8df6b4221381c438b9a7348", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/932a86a711c722b45ed47ba2103adca34d225b33", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b14aa5673e0a8077ff4b74f0bb260735e7d5e6a4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c15a688e49987385baa8804bf65d570e362f8576", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
