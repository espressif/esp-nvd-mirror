This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10381", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-52337", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2324541", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
