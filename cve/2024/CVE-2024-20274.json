An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content to an affected device and using the device to generate a document that contains sensitive information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the standard layout of the device-generated documents, access arbitrary files from the underlying operating system, and conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user account with policy-editing permissions, such as Network Admin, Intrusion Admin, or any custom user role with the same capabilities."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-html-inj-nfJeYHxz", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}, {"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-M446vbEO", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}, {"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
