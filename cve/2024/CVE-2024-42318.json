Landlock only implements the\ncred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes\nall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.\n\nThis basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()\nand keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on\nitself.\n\nFix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the\nexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()\ncall hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to\naccidentally diverge in the future.)"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2566", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d74fd54db0bd0c0c224bef0da8fc95ea9c9f36c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16896914bace82d7811c62f3b6d5320132384f49", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39705a6c29f8a2b93cf5b99528a55366c50014d1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b14cc2cf313bd29056fadbc8ecd7f957cf5791ff", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240817.shahka3Ee1iy@digikod.net/", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/17/2", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
