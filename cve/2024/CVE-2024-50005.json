According\nto RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable\nbehavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing\nuse-after-free issues.\n\nThis possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed\nby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.\n\nTo address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local\nvariable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical\nsection. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,\nensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU\nrules."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/540138377b22f601f06f55ebfa3ca171dcab471a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bff1709b3980bd7f80be6786f64cc9a9ee9e56da", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d18f669461811dfe2915d5554ab2a9834f810013", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e676e4ea76bbe7f1156d8c326b9b6753849481c2", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
