In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8312", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8338", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9050", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2313828", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
