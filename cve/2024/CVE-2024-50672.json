The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user input, which is used as a query in Mongoose's find() function. This makes it possible for attackers to perform a full takeover of the administrator account. Attackers can then use the newly gained administrative privileges to upload a custom plugin to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the web application."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/dos-m0nk3y/CVE/tree/main/CVE-2024-50672", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
