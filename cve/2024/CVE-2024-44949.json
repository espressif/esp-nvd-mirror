If\none of these allocations is written using DMA and the other is written\nusing cached write, the value that was written with DMA may be\ncorrupted.\n\nThis commit changes ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to be 128 on PA20 and 32 on PA1.1 -\nthat's the largest possible cache line size.\n\nAs different parisc microarchitectures have different cache line size, we\ndefine arch_slab_minalign(), cache_line_size() and\ndma_get_cache_alignment() so that the kernel may tune slab cache\nparameters dynamically, based on the detected cache line size."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/533de2f470baac40d3bf622fe631f15231a03c9f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/642a0b7453daff0295310774016fcb56d1f5bc7f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7ae04ba36b381bffe2471eff3a93edced843240f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
