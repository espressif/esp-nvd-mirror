It is also possible to impersonate the broker, because TLS is not used to identify the real MQTT broker. This means that MQTT communications are vulnerable to MitM attacks at the TCP/IP level."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://en.sungrowpower.com/security-notice-detail-2/5961", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
