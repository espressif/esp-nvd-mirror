When the frag size is larger than PAGE_SIZE,\neverything is fine. However, if the frag is only one page and the\ntotal size of the buffer and virtnet_rq_dma is larger than one page, an\noverflow may occur.\n\nThe commit f9dac92ba908 (\"virtio_ring: enable premapped mode whatever\nuse_dma_api\") introduced this problem. And we reverted some commits to\nfix this in last linux version. Now we try to enable it and fix this\nbug directly.\n\nHere, when the frag size is not enough, we reduce the buffer len to fix\nthis problem."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67a11de8965c2ab19e215fb6651d44847e068614", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6aacd1484468361d1d04badfe75f264fa5314864", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8f7d6963768b114ec9644ff0148dde4c104e84b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
