This\nattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the\narray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a\nkernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.\n\nThis patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with\nlist_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for\nallocating memory for the array.
