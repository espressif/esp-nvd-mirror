This issue occurs when the plugin prompts the user to save these credentials within Okta Personal. A fix was implemented to properly escape these fields, addressing the vulnerability. Importantly, if Okta Personal is not added to the plugin to enable multi-account view, the Workforce Identity Cloud plugin is not affected by this issue. The vulnerability is fixed in Okta Browser Plugin version 6.32.0 for Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "psirt@okta.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 4.2}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "psirt@okta.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-browser-plugin-reflected-cross-site-scripting-cve-2024-0981", "source": "psirt@okta.com"}]}}
