FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.\n 3. Freeze completes.\n 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which\n    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:\n\n  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)\n  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]\n  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]\n  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0\n\nWhich is the following line:\n\n  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);\n\nWhich ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg\nnoise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.\n\nTo avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during\ndquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after\nfreeze."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e6ff207cd5bd924ad94cd1a7c633bcdac0ba1cb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f3821acd7c3143145999248087de5fb4b48cf26", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ea87e34792258825d290f4dc5216276e91cb224", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5abba5e0e586e258ded3e798fe5f69c66fec198", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab6cfcf8ed2c7496f55d020b65b1d8cd55d9a2cb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac6f420291b3fee1113f21d612fa88b628afab5b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcacb52a985f1b6d280f698a470b873dfe52728a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
