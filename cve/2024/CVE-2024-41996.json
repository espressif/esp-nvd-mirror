The client may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate the order of the public key."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/details/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/faq/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/abccc14d4d96c0442f3a77fa5ca255d1", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
