This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV30": [{"source": "security@huntr.dev", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.0", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@huntr.dev", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1220"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/35afd4439464571eb016318cd7b6f85a162225ca", "source": "security@huntr.dev"}, {"url": "https://huntr.com/bounties/460df515-164c-4435-954b-0233a181545f", "source": "security@huntr.dev"}]}}
