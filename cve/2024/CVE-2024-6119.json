This may result in an exception that terminates the\napplication program.\n\nNote that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not\naffected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also\nspecifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.\n\nTLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they\ngenerally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected\nidentity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the\ncertificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity\nof the issue is Moderate.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "openssl-security@openssl.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-843"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/05f360d9e849a1b277db628f1f13083a7f8dd04f", "source": "openssl-security@openssl.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/06d1dc3fa96a2ba5a3e22735a033012aadc9f0d6", "source": "openssl-security@openssl.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/621f3729831b05ee828a3203eddb621d014ff2b2", "source": "openssl-security@openssl.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7dfcee2cd2a63b2c64b9b4b0850be64cb695b0a0", "source": "openssl-security@openssl.org"}, {"url": "https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20240903.txt", "source": "openssl-security@openssl.org"}]}}
