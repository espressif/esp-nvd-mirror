This can leak skbs until the send\nbuffer is full which makes sending more packets impossible.\n\nFix this by freeing the skb in the error path if we are currently dealing\nwith the first frag, i.e., an skb allocated in this iteration of\nxsk_build_skb."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c0d0f42ffa6ac94cd79893b7ed419c15e1b45de", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f0d0dd5a7f437d83cff954bc321f1a9b181efd5", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5d346deb65efa8453f8481bcea75c1a590439e7", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
