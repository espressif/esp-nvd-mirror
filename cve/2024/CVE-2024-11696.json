This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications on the user's computer have not tampered with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this issue. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1929600", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}, {"url": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-63/", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}, {"url": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-64/", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}, {"url": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-67/", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}, {"url": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-68/", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}]}}
