This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver\nalso tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in\ntb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() waiting for the domain lock.\n\nHowever, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so\nthere is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do that\nanymore. Furthermore it already checks if the XDomain is unplugged and\nbails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain as\nunplugged when we remove the parent router."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18b3ad2a3cc877dd4b16f48d84aa27b78d53bf1d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23ce6ba3b95488a2b9e9f6d43b340da0c15395dc", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/747bc154577de6e6af4bc99abfa859b8419bb4d8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7ca24cf9163c112bb6b580c6fb57c04a1f8b76e1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/80ac8d194831eca0c2f4fd862f7925532fda320c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e2006140ad2e01a02ed0aff49cc2ae3ceeb11f8d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
