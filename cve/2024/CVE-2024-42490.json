Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 4.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-285"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-qxqc-27pr-wgc8", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
