Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.\n\nA server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV40": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "4.0", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnerableSystemConfidentiality": "HIGH", "vulnerableSystemIntegrity": "HIGH", "vulnerableSystemAvailability": "HIGH", "subsequentSystemConfidentiality": "NONE", "subsequentSystemIntegrity": "NONE", "subsequentSystemAvailability": "NONE", "exploitMaturity": "NOT_DEFINED", "confidentialityRequirements": "NOT_DEFINED", "integrityRequirements": "NOT_DEFINED", "availabilityRequirements": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedAttackVector": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedAttackComplexity": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedAttackRequirements": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedPrivilegesRequired": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedUserInteraction": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedVulnerableSystemConfidentiality": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedVulnerableSystemIntegrity": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedVulnerableSystemAvailability": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedSubsequentSystemConfidentiality": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedSubsequentSystemIntegrity": "NOT_DEFINED", "modifiedSubsequentSystemAvailability": "NOT_DEFINED", "safety": "NOT_DEFINED", "automatable": "NOT_DEFINED", "recovery": "NOT_DEFINED", "valueDensity": "NOT_DEFINED", "vulnerabilityResponseEffort": "NOT_DEFINED", "providerUrgency": "NOT_DEFINED", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-rmj9-23rg-gr67", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
