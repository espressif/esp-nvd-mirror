This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.3, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-80"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-for-wordpress/blob/main/includes/views/parts/lists-overview-details.php", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-for-wordpress/commit/60c6bfc260a7974f791af1d4ad4a032a3e0bdd3c", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mailchimp-for-wp/trunk/includes/views/parts/lists-overview-details.php", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3153075%40mailchimp-for-wp%2Ftrunk&old=3149806%40mailchimp-for-wp%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/aa464547-0380-4b91-a5ea-0cd9a66da7a7?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
