This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the product's repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/d9302021472c3e7e23bac8c3d5fbec57a5f38f0c", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.synacktiv.com/advisories/invoiceninja-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-when-appkey-known", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
