Therefore\ncancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the\nhelper know of the calling context.\n\nReferences: 746ae46c1113 (\"drm/sched: Mark scheduler work queues with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM\")"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de35994ecd2dd6148ab5a6c5050a1670a04dec77", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ffb231471a407c96e114070bf828cd2378fdf431", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
