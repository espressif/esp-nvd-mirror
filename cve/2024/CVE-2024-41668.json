When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication, cBioPortal could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances. A fix has been released in version 6.0.12. As a workaround, one might be able to disable `/proxy` endpoint entirely via, for example, nginx."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
