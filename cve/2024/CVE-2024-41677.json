A potential mutation XSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/v1.5.5/packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/commit/7e742eb3a1001542d795776c0317d47df8b9d64e", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
