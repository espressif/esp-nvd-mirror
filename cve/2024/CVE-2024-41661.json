In versions 1.2.0 through 2.1.1, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the WAF detection tool allows an authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root user. The URL query parameter `url` is passed to `subprocess.check_output` without any sanitization, resulting in a command injection vulnerability. This API endpoint is accessible by authenticated users with any use role. Because the process runs as `root`, an attacker has root access. Commit edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e contains a patch for the issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-78"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/53d9f505f04861a5040195ea71f20907ff90577a/web/api/views.py#L268-L275", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/3d5f1724dd12cf9861443742e7d7c02ff8c75a6f", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/security/advisories/GHSA-fx7f-f735-vgh4", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
