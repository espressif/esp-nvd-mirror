When two\nSMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to\nresume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is\ninterrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated\na waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.\n\nTo avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard\nSMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9960085a3a82c58d3323c1c20b991db6045063b0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdf7efe4b02aa93813db0bf1ca596ad298ab6b06", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e40115c33c0d79c940545b6b12112aace7acd9f5", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
