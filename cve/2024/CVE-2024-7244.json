This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Panda Security Dome. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the VPN process. The process does not restrict DLL search to trusted paths, which can result in the loading of a malicious DLL. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
