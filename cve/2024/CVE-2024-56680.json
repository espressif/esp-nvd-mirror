We need to handle properly\ncase when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq line\nand IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff from\nISR_STATUS register and handle all irq's cases, for what we are not\nnot prepared and usually hang the whole system.\n\nTo avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check if\nthe device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irq\nuntil the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1429826883bb18847092b2e04c6598ef34bae1d4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57241487a3648515c9aa6fa89e31f2414eccfdbc", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed4524c87249edc3104f6bb28ab11325bed3d536", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
