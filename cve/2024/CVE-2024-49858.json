So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY\ninstead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversion\nlogic."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/11690d7e76842f29b60fbb5b35bc97d206ea0e83", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19fd2f2c5fb36b61506d3208474bfd8fdf1cada3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e6871a632a99d9b9e2ce3a7847acabe99e5a26e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38d9b07d99b789efb6d8dda21f1aaad636c38993", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b22c038fb2757c652642933de5664da471f8cb7", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77d48d39e99170b528e4f2e9fc5d1d64cdedd386", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f76b69ab9cf04358266e3cea5748c0c2791fbb08", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
