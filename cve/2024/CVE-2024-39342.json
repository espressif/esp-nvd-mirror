These keys are not uniquely generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can be obtained from \"WebAPI.cfg.xml\" in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead to privilege escalation on the Windows host."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/VAMorales/21a8700a67d80c263b38e693fd528313", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://trustedcare.entrust.com/login", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.entrust.com/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
