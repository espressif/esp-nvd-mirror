These operations include arbitrary file deletion and writing, loading and unloading daemons, manipulating file permissions, and loading extensions, among other actions.\n\n\nThe vulnerable module\u00a0org.cindori.SenseiHelper\u00a0can be contacted via XPC. While the module performs client validation, it relies on the client's PID\u00a0obtained through the public processIdentifier\u00a0property of the NSXPCConnection\u00a0class. This approach makes the module susceptible to a PID Reuse Attack, enabling an attacker to impersonate a legitimate client and send crafted XPC messages to invoke arbitrary methods exposed by the HelperProtocol\u00a0interface."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "41c37e40-543d-43a2-b660-2fee83ea851a", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "41c37e40-543d-43a2-b660-2fee83ea851a", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-863"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports", "source": "41c37e40-543d-43a2-b660-2fee83ea851a"}]}}
