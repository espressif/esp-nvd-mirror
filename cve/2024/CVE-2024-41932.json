That's fine; we\nhave a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN\nset up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with\nthe requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its\ntrivial to create this condition.\n\nReproduced the warning by the following setup:\n\n- $PID inside a cpuset cgroup\n- another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1\n- another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5c3fb75f538cfcb886f6dfeb497d99fc2f263ee6", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70ee7947a29029736a1a06c73a48ff37674a851b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
