Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to\ntarget->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from\nthe kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,\nand the issue does not provide a write mechanism.\n\nFix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset\nfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,\nNT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing\ncontents of POR_EL1 will be retained.\n\nBefore this patch:\n\n| # ./poe-test\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n|\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0xffff8000839c3d50\n\nAfter this patch:\n\n| # ./poe-test\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n|\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4105dd76bc8ad6529d47157ef0565cb84ca6676c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/594bfc4947c4fcabba1318d8384c61a29a6b89fb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
