The warning triggers from the legacy fallback stub.\n\nThat warning is bogus as the PCI/MSI layer knows whether a PCI/MSI parent\ndomain is associated with the device or not. There is a check for MSI-X,\nwhich has a legacy assumption. But that legacy fallback assumption is only\nvalid when legacy support is enabled, but otherwise the check should simply\nreturn -ENOTSUPP.\n\nLoongarch tripped over the same problem and blindly enabled legacy support\nwithout implementing the legacy fallbacks. There are weak implementations\nwhich return an error, so the problem was papered over.\n\nCorrect pci_msi_domain_supports() to evaluate the legacy mode and add\nthe missing supported check into the MSI enable path to complete it."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a60b990798eb17433d0283788280422b1bd94b18", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aed157301c659a48f5564cc4568cf0e5c8831af0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1f7476e07b93d65a1a3643dcb4a7bed80d4328d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
