A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-ghsa-gg56-vj58-g5mc/pull/1", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80/server/controllers/LibraryController.js#L43-L47", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
