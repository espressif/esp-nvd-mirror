But when ACPI is enabled we go through a\nspecific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for\nthe node that was acquired.\n\nSince we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we\ncan simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and\nwe are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.\nThis prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.\n\nMoreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring\nthe device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/303846a3dc275e35fbb556d72f1e356ba669e4f8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/37233169a6ea912020c572f870075a63293b786a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
