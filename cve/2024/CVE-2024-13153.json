This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code, to apply the patch, the affected widgets: Image Tooltip, Notification, Simple Popup, Video Play Button, and Card Carousel, must be deleted and reinstalled manually."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://unlimited-elements.com/change-log/", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/#developers", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/99625a3e-b8a4-42f8-8996-f7c5c0ff2d5f?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
