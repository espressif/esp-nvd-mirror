An effort is\nunder way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context,\nbut until then lets schedule the unregistration.\n\nA side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen\nafter the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, is\ngone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL\npointer dereference.\nThis does however result in the user being informed about this error by\nthe following entry in the kernel log:\n\n  ucsi_glink.pmic_glink_ucsi pmic_glink.ucsi.0: failed to send UCSI write request: -5"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/095b0001aefddcd9361097c971b7debc84e72714", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/11bb2ffb679399f99041540cf662409905179e3a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
