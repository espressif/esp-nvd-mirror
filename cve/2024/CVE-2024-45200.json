The victim is not required to join a game session with an attacker. The victim must open the \"Wireless Play\" (or \"LAN Play\") menu from the game's title screen, and an attacker nearby (LDN) or on the same LAN network as the victim can send a crafted reply packet to the victim's console. This enables a remote attacker to obtain complete denial-of-service on the game's process, or potentially, remote code execution on the victim's console. The issue is caused by incorrect use of the Nintendo Pia library,"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/latte-soft/kartlanpwn", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2611669", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
