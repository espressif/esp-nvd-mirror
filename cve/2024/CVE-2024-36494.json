The login page at /cgi/slogin.cgi suffers from XSS due to improper input filtering of the -tsetup+-uuser parameter, which can only be exploited if the target user is not already logged in. This makes it ideal for login form phishing attempts."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "551230f0-3615-47bd-b7cc-93e92e730bbf", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://r.sec-consult.com/imageaccess", "source": "551230f0-3615-47bd-b7cc-93e92e730bbf"}, {"url": "https://www.imageaccess.de/?page=SupportPortal&lang=en", "source": "551230f0-3615-47bd-b7cc-93e92e730bbf"}]}}
