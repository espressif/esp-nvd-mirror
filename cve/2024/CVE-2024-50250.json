This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not\naligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in\nthe file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the\nwrong place.\n\nIf iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a\npage, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the\ndestination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality\nbecause we expose stale pmem contents.\n\nFix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page\nboundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that\nwe always copy full blocks.\n\nWe're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,\nso programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the\nold memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.\n\nBe careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still\nneed to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're\noperating on."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50793801fc7f6d08def48754fb0f0706b0cfc394", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e9c0f500b42216ef930f5c0d1703989a451913d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bc18bb476e50e32e5d08f2734d63d63e0fa528c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bdbc96c23197d773a7d1bf03e4f11de593b0ff28", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
