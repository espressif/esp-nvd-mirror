The leak occurs when multiple\nthreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to\ninconsistent state and potential memory leaks.\n\nTo fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing\nvf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock),\nensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.\n\nAdditionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in\ni40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.\n2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting\n\tportvlan and/or mac filters).\n3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the\n\tmac_filter_hash.\n\nThis synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents\nthe described leak."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/703c4d820b31bcadf465288d5746c53445f02a55", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8831abff1bd5b6bc8224f0c0671f46fbd702b5b2", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a9747288ba0a9ad4f5c9877f18dd245770ad64e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9db6ce9e2738b05a3672aff4d42169cf3bb5a3e3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dac6c7b3d33756d6ce09f00a96ea2ecd79fae9fb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
