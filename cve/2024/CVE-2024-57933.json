As it stands, if the interface is down, disabling\nor enabling XSK pools would result in a crash, as the RX queue pointer\nwould be NULL. XSK pool registration will occur as part of the next\ninterface up.\n\nSimilarly, xsk_wakeup needs be guarded against queues disappearing\nwhile the function is executing, so a check against the\nGVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED flag is added to synchronize with the\ndisabling of the bit and the synchronize_net() in gve_turndown."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/40338d7987d810fcaa95c500b1068a52b08eec9b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/771d66f2bd8c4dba1286a9163ab982cecd825718", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e8d7037c89437af12725f454e2eaf40e8166c0f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
