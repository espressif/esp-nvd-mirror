The XmlScanner class has a scan method which should prevent XXE attacks. However, prior to versions 1.9.4, 2.1.3, 2.3.2, and 3.4.0, the regexes used in the `scan` method and the findCharSet method can be bypassed by using UCS-4 and encoding guessing. An attacker can bypass the sanitizer and achieve an XML external entity attack. Versions 1.9.4, 2.1.3, 2.3.2, and 3.4.0 fix the issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-611"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-jw4x-v69f-hh5w", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-guessing-no-ext-info", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
