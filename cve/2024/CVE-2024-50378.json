While this risk is limited to users with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version, which addresses this issue. Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables from the log table."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@apache.org", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-201"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43123", "source": "security@apache.org"}, {"url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/17rxys384lzfd6nhm3fztzgvk47zy7jb", "source": "security@apache.org"}]}}
