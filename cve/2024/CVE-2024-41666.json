Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 3.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-269"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fynj5Sho8Lf8CETqsNXZyPKlTDdmgJuN/view?usp=sharing", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/05edb2a9ca48f0f10608c1b49fbb0cf7164f6476", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/e96f32d233504101ddac028a5bf8117433d333d6", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/ef535230d8bd8ad7b18aab1ea1063e9751d348c4", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-v8wx-v5jq-qhhw", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
