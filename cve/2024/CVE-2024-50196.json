In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent\ninterrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;\nchained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to\nservice the parent interrupt.\n\nMoving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop\nensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the\nhardware.\n\nThe similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions\nwrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:\n```\ngrep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl\n```"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/20728e86289ab463b99b7ab4425515bd26aba417", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a81800ef05bea5a9896f199677f7b7f5020776a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/655f5d4662b958122b260be05aa6dfdf8768efe6", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/93b8ddc54507a227087c60a0013ed833b6ae7d3c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dcbe9954634807ec54e22bde278b5b269f921381", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
