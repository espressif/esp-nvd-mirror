This causes\nnfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs\ncontext as we're only going to write to the cache.\n\nFix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a\nwarning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.\n\nFurther, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free the\ncontext if the pointer is NULL."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13a07cc81e2d116cece727a83746c74b87a9d417", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86ad1a58f6a9453f49e06ef957a40a8dac00a13f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
