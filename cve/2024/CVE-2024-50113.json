These helper functions are\nguaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application\nincludes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected\nto parent device.\n\nThis bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or\nmore ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path\nto update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection\nfault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.\n\nThis commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90753a38bc3d058820981f812a908a99f7b337c1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6a6780e0b9bbcf311a727afed06fee533a5e957", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
