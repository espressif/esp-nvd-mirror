The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware\nreturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region\nreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.\n\nFix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox\nresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not\ntimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bba47fe3b038cca3d3ebd799665ce69d6d273b58", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ede596b1434b57c0b3fd5c02b326efe5c54f6e48", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
