The issue arises from improper sanitization of user input passed to the \"position\" GET parameter in the tilt.php script. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted input data that includes malicious command sequences, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and poses significant risk if the application is exposed to untrusted networks."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/recantha/camera-pi/blob/ef018d212288cb16404f0b050593d20f0dc0467b/www/tilt.php#L4", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://jacobmasse.medium.com/cve-2024-44809-remote-code-execution-in-raspberry-pi-camera-project-4b8e3486a628", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
