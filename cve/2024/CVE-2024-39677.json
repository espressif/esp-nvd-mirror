A SQL injection vulnerability exists in some types implementing ILiteralType.ObjectToSQLString. Callers of these methods are exposed to the vulnerability, which includes mappings using inheritance with discriminator values; HQL queries referencing a static field of the application; users of the SqlInsertBuilder and SqlUpdateBuilder utilities, calling their AddColumn overload taking a literal value; and any direct use of the ObjectToSQLString methods for building SQL queries on the user side. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.4.9 and 5.5.2."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-89"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/commit/b4a69d1a5ff5744312478d70308329af496e4ba9", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/issues/3516", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/pull/3517", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/pull/3547", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/security/advisories/GHSA-fg4q-ccq8-3r5q", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
