It allows authenticated users to exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting. This issue permits unauthorized HTTP requests to be sent to internal services, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining Command Injection within the internal service. When combined with existing XSS vulnerabilities, this SSRF issue can further facilitate Remote Code Execution (RCE)."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.9#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.1.1#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.15/P46#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P41#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Responsible_Disclosure_Policy", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
