All of the devices internet interfaces share a similar MAC address that only varies in their final octet. This allows network-adjacent attackers to derive the support user's SSH password by decrementing the final octet of the connected gateway address or via the BSSID. An attacker can then execute arbitrary OS commands with root-level privileges."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/CVE-2024-39345", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/TBA", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
