An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a wireless network that is configured for CWA and sending traffic through an affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL before user authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device before the user authentication is completed, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-863"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-cwa-acl-nPSbHSnA", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
