This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Silicon Labs Gecko OS. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the debug interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23184"}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "cve@asrg.io", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "cve@asrg.io", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-121"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://community.silabs.com/a45Vm0000000Atp", "source": "cve@asrg.io"}, {"url": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-868/", "source": "cve@asrg.io"}]}}
