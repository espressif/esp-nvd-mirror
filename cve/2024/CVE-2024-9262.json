This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the  'user-meta-public-profile' shortcode is used insecurely."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-639"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-meta/trunk/models/classes/generate/PublicProfile.php#L28", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4ed81348-7604-4858-bc8e-b4504d77ee45?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
