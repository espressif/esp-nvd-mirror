More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if\nit were serious issues.\n\nThis patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()\ninstead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to\nthe prefix, too."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36c0764474b637bbee498806485bed524cad486b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b2e538a9827dd04ab5273bf4be8eb2edb84357b0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5a1ca7b59804d6779644001a878ed925a4688ca", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
