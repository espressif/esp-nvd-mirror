This leads to a UAF.\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked\n\nThis race condition arises as follows:\n- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:\n  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`\n- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using\n  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls\n  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.\n- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,\n  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:\n  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`\n  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.\n\nThe discovery of this UAF can be referenced in the following PR for\nsyzkaller's support for SMB requests."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96261adb998a3b513468b6ce17dbec76be5507d4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a8c5d89d327ff58e9b2517f8a6afb4181d32c6e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a96f9eb7add30ba0fafcfe7b7aca090978196800", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f20b77f7897e6aab9ce5527e6016ad2be5d70a33", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
