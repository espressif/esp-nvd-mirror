An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 4.2}]}, "references": [{"url": "https://blog.clamav.net/2024/09/clamav-141-132-107-and-010312-security.html", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
