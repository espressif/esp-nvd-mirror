This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 2.8, "baseSeverity": "LOW"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.3, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-476"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43167", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2303456", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/1072", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/pull/1073/files", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
