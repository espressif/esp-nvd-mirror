This chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 6.0}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1327"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-749"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/blob/master/daemon/cups-browsed.c#L13992", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://www.cups.org", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
