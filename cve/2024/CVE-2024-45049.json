It is possible to trigger evaluations in Hydra without any authentication. Depending on the size of evaluations, this can impact the availability of systems. The problem can be fixed by applying https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5 to any Hydra package. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should deny the `/api/push` route in a reverse proxy. This also breaks the \"Evaluate jobset\" button in the frontend."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-306"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-xv29-v93r-2f5v", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337766", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/113029832631860419", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
