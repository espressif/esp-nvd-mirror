But *before*\nkill_and_confirm of sq->ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq\nlive reference). In this case, sq->ctrl was allocated however after it was\ncaptured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.\nThis prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.\n\nSolve this by re-capturing the sq->ctrl after all inflight request has\ncompleted, where for sure sq->ctrl reference is final, and move forward\nbased on that.\n\nThis issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting\nmultiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl\nleading up to this race window."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f3c22b1d3d7e86712253244797a651998c141fa", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5502c1f1d0d7472706cc1f201aecf1c935d302d1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/818004f2a380420c19872171be716174d4985e33", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/940a71f08ef153ef807f751310b0648d1fa5d0da", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4fed1443a6571d49c6ffe7d97af3bbe5ee6dff5", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c758b77d4a0a0ed3a1292b3fd7a2aeccd1a169a4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
