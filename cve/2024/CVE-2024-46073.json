The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the \"next\" parameter, which is included in the application's response without adequate escaping. An attacker can exploit this flaw by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, causing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The issue occurs even though the application has sanitization mechanisms in place."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/gamonoid/icehrm", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/manisashank/CVE-Publish/blob/main/CVE-2024-46073.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
