Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.3, "impactScore": 5.8}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-74"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
