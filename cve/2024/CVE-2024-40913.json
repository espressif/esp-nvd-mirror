However, at this point we may not have gotten the reference count of\nthe cache, but we will put it during colse fd, so this may cause a cache\nUAF.\n\nSo grab the cache reference count before fd_install(). In addition, by\nkernel convention, fd is taken over by the user land after fd_install(),\nand the kernel should not call close_fd() after that, i.e., it should call\nfd_install() after everything is ready, thus fd_install() is called after\ncopy_to_user() succeeds."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b4391e77a6bf24cba2ef1590e113d9b73b11039", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9f58cdae6a364a3270fd6b6a46e0fd4f7f8ce32", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2d3eb377a5d081bf2bed177d354a4f59b74da88", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eac51d9daacd61dcc93333ff6a890cf3efc8c1c0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
