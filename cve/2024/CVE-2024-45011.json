This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().\n\nOn top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT\nendpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced\nfrom a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device\nwhile probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().\n\nA XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data\ntowards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This is\nwhy setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1371d32b95972d39c1e6e4bae8b6d0df1b573731", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2374bf7558de915edc6ec8cb10ec3291dfab9594", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25ee8b2908200fc862c0434e5ad483817d50ceda", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4267131278f5cc98f8db31d035d64bdbbfe18658", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5cff754692ad45d5086b75fef8cc3a99c30a1005", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
