This vulnerability enables malicious actors to create new user accounts without proper authorization.\n\nExploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to create multiple low-privileged user accounts, gaining unauthorized access to the system. Additionally, continuous exploitation could lead to system resource exhaustion through mass user creation."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ed10eef1-636d-4fbe-9993-6890dfa878f8", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "references": [{"url": "https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2024/WSO2-2024-3574/", "source": "ed10eef1-636d-4fbe-9993-6890dfa878f8"}]}}
