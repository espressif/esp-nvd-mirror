This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version 1.1.2."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-288"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184657/multimanager-wp", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184678/multimanager-wp", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184826/multimanager-wp", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de8e7adc-3777-4fb1-a708-68da950e3d4f?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
