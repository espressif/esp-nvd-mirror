An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1025"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-xss-yjj7ZjVq", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}, {"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-M446vbEO", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}, {"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-rf-bypass-OY8f3pnM", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}, {"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
