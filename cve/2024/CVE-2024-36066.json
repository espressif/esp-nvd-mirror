CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4211#section-4.4", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://support.keyfactor.com/hc/en-us/articles/26965687021595-EJBCA-Security-Advisory-EJBCA-standalone-CMP-CLI-client", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
