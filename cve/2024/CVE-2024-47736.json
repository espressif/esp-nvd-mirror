If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cfa199bcbbbba31cbf97b2786f44f4464f3f29a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e2f9d34dd12e6e5b244ec488bcebd0c2d566c50", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9b30af0e86ffb485301ecd83b9129c9dfb7ebf8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
