Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 6.0}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-74"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/commit/29627fd0d5f152e2da59671987090ea0a5c29874", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-167_monkeytype", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
