Later we\nreplaced the use of the system workqueue with our own private\nworkqueue but hadn't rerun the AER handler testing since then."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13355dd37e22edbcb99c599f783233188740a650", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/746e6ae2e202b062b9deee7bd86d94937997ecd7", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
