A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.330 permits attackers to upload arbitrary files to attacker-chosen locations on the server, including JavaScript, enabling the execution of commands within those files. This issue could result in unauthorized access, full server compromise, data leakage, and other critical security threats. This does not affect `agnai.chat`, installations using S3-compatible storage, or self-hosting that is not publicly exposed. This does affect publicly hosted installs without S3-compatible storage. Version 1.0.330 fixes this vulnerability."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-35"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/security/advisories/GHSA-mpch-89gm-hm83", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
