With bad\ntiming we can teardown the driver with one or more work workqueue still\nbeing alive leading to various UAF splats. Add a fini step to ensure\nuser queues are properly torn down. At this point GuC should already be\nnuked so queue itself should no longer be referenced from hw pov.\n\nv2 (Matt B)\n - Looks much safer to use a waitqueue and then just wait for the\n   xa_array to become empty before triggering the drain.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 861108666cc0e999cffeab6aff17b662e68774e3)"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/272b0e78874586d6ccae04079d75b27b47705544", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d2be279f1ca9e7288282d4214f16eea8a727cdb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/421c74670b0f9d5c007f1276d3647aa58f407fde", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
