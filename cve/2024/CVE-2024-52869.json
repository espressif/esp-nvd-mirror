Specifically, when there is an operating system move from SUSE Enterprise Linux Server (SLES) 12 Service Pack (SP) 2 or 3 to SLES 15 SP2 on Teradata Database systems, some service/system user accounts, and possibly systems administrator created user accounts, are incorrectly assigned to groups that allow higher system-level privileges than intended for those user accounts. Depending on the usage of these accounts, this may lead to full system compromise."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://chrismanson.com/CVE/cve-2024-52869.html", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.teradata.com/trust-security-center/data-security", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
