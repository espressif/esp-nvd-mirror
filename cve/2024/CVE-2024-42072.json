When offset is negative\nit should be patched differently.\nThe 2nd bug is in the verifier:\nwhen current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth\nit means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune\nexploration of the program at this point.\nNote, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,\nsince 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only\nin the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state\nwill have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns\nand the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/175827e04f4be53f3dfb57edf12d0d49b18fd939", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b2efe1937ca9f8815884bd4dcd5b32733025103", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
