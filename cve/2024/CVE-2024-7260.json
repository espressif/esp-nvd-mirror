A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.\r\n\r\nOnce a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 2.5}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-601"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7260", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2301875", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
