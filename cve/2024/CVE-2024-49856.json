Note how nid_of_current will\nnever be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not\nset in sgx_numa_mask.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not\nto setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on\neach node can enhance performance, it is not a requirement for\nfunctionality.\n\nRework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory.
