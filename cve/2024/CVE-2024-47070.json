A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 6.0}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-287"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxf-mmg9-9hg7", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
