At driver removal time, the clocks are\ndisabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end of\nthe remove process due to the devm usage.\nThis is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registers\nwhich assumes clocks are enabled. A crash can be triggered by removing\nthe driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.\nThis patch frees the interrupts at each lima device finishing callback\nso that the handlers are already unregistered by the time we fully\ndisable clocks."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04d531b9a1875846d4f89953b469ad463aa7a770", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a487e977cb8897ae4c51ecd34bbaa2b005266c9", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d60c43df59ef01c08dc7b0c45495178f9d05a13", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/17fe8b75aaf0bb1bdc31368963446b421c22d0af", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25d0d9b83d855cbc5d5aa5ae3cd79d55ea0c84a8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a6683c690bbfd1f371510cb051e8fa49507f3f5e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5daf9217a50636a969bc1965f827878aeb09ffe", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
