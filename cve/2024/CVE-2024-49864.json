This is a problem, however, as there's a gap\nbetween the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()\nfrom the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O\nthread.\n\nAs a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's\nno I/O thread yet.\n\nA better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such\nthat the socket creation is done by the I/O thread."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56e415202b8a17de6496f4023e545fcb66f118ec", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc212465326e8587325f520a052346f0b57360e6", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c64f5fc95e9612fdf75587c8e21e494e614c18e2", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdf4bbbdb956d7426f687f38757ebca2a2759a0f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
