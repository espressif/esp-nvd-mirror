After\nconsidering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can\nhandle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry\ntimeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets\nreceived beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed\nout by the time they are handled by user-space.\n\nNotably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like\ntimed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1288cf1cceb0e6df276e182f5412370fb4169bcb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62349fbf86b5e13b02721bdadf98c29afd1e7b5f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63d202d948bb6d3a28cd8e8b96b160fa53e18baa", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a6627fba793cc75b7365d9504a0095fb2902dda4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4913702419d064ec4c4bbf7270643c95cc89a1b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b8c5f635997f49c625178d1a0cb32a80ed33abe6", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca0b44e20a6f3032224599f02e7c8fb49525c894", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d73cb8862e4d6760ccc94d3b57b9ef6271400607", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
