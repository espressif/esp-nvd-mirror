When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time\nsequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do\nout-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value\n`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be\nmoved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.\nMeanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without\ntermination and out-of-bound write.\n2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements\nwill just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment\n\"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".\n\nFor more details, please refer to\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31ff8464ef540785344994986a010031410f9ff3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5acc3f971a01be48d5ff4252d8f9cdb87998cdfb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5046de32fd1532c3f67065197fc1da82f0b5193", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
