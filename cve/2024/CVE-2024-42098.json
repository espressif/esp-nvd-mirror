In that\nscenario, some key material from the previous key would not be\noverwritten. The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire\nprivate_key array first.\n\nNote that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:\npreviously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key would\nremain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior is\nconsistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_valid\nfails."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39173b04abda87872b43c331468a4a14f8f05ce8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73e5984e540a76a2ee1868b91590c922da8c24c9", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/80575b252ab0358b7e93895b2a510beb3cb3f975", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d96187eb8e59b572a8e6a68b6a9837a867ea29df", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fd7ef325911eba1b7191b83cb580463242f2090d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
