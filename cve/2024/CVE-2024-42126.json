We don't see any issue when\npercpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with\nCONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu\nallocation can come from the vmalloc area.\n\nWith kernel command line \"percpu_alloc=page\" we can force percpu allocation\nto come from vmalloc area and can see kernel crash in machine_check_early:\n\n[    1.215714] NIP [c000000000e49eb4] rcu_nmi_enter+0x24/0x110\n[    1.215717] LR [c0000000000461a0] machine_check_early+0xf0/0x2c0\n[    1.215719] --- interrupt: 200\n[    1.215720] [c000000fffd73180] [0000000000000000] 0x0 (unreliable)\n[    1.215722] [c000000fffd731b0] [0000000000000000] 0x0\n[    1.215724] [c000000fffd73210] [c000000000008364] machine_check_early_common+0x134/0x1f8\n\nFix this by avoiding use of nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() in real mode if percpu\nfirst chunk is not embedded."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0db880fc865ffb522141ced4bfa66c12ab1fbb70", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0f37946c62c48a907625348cbc720a7a0c547d1e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c78c9411e685dbc9eac8c2845111b03501975b8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d3f83dfb23674540c827a8d65fba20aa300b252", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
