This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 5.2}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/funnelforms-free/tags/3.7.3.2/admin/menu_ajax_functions/formularbuilder_fonts.php#L59", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/funnelforms-free/tags/3.7.4.1/admin/menu_ajax_functions/formularbuilder_fonts.php?rev=3141470#L17", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3e815531-f966-44a1-a037-8077a40c83b0?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
