The error path would then call\nmtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev\nwas allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointer\ndereference.\n\nBy moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called when\nmtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated.
