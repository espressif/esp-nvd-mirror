This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: Successful exploitation by Contributor-level users requires an Administrator-level user to provide access to the plugin's admin area via the `Access` plugin setting, which is restricted to administrators by default."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3166480/accordion-slider", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/94f19f56-0667-443e-8545-a17fbe9c3ddb?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
