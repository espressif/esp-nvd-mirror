This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.\n\nUsers are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@apache.org", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1188"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://solr.apache.org/security.html#cve-2024-45217-apache-solr-configsets-created-during-a-backup-restore-command-are-trusted-implicitly", "source": "security@apache.org"}]}}
