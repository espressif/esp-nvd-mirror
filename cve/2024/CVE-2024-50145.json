If\nskb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we\nshouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the\noctep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no\nassociated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them\nup the network stack - they are skipped.\n\nHelper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers\nused by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to\nmark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09ce491112bbf0b866e2638d3e961c1c73d1f00b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2dedcb6f99f4c1a11944e7cc35dbeb9b18a5cbac", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2d2dc4f88bb3cfc4f3cc320fd3ff51b0ae5b0ea", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb592008f79be52ccef88cd9a5249b3fc0367278", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
