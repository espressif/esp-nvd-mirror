This is deferred to 3)\n\n2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.\n   This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.\n\n3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.\n\nThis means that host wide ratelimit is still effective\nin keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.\n\nAs a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path\ncan use a lock-free operation."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/483397b4ba280813e4a9c161a0a85172ddb43d19", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/662ec52260cc07b9ae53ecd3925183c29d34288b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c2bd38b95f75f3d2a08c93e35303e26d480d24e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/997ba8889611891f91e8ad83583466aeab6239a3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7722921adb046e3836eb84372241f32584bdb07", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
