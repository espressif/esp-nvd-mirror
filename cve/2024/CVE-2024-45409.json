Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.8}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-347"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/1ec5392bc506fe43a02dbb66b68741051c5ffeae", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/4865d030cae9705ee5cdb12415c654c634093ae7", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-jw9c-mfg7-9rx2", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
