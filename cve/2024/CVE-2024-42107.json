The ice driver has already\nreleased the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external\ntimestamp event occurs.\n\nTo fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the\nPTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c4e524811918600683b1ea87a5e0fc2db64fa9b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/996422e3230e41468f652d754fefd1bdbcd4604e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
