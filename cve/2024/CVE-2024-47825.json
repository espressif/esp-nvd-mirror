Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.16 and 1.15.10, a policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than `/32` may be ignored if there is a policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) and this narrower policy rule specifies either `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`. Note that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` or that set `toEntities` to `all`, some workarounds are available. For users with policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false`, remove this configuration option and explicitly define any allow rules required. For users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities: all`, use `toEntities: world`."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-276"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwx-63fv-pfq6", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
