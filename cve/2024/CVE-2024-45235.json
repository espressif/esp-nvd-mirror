A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing an Authority Key Identifier extension that lacks the keyIdentifier field. Fort references this pointer without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
