An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited Administrator functions such as viewing portions of the web UI, generating config only or full backup files, and deleting tech support files. This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.5}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-862"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndhs-uaapi-Jh4V6zpN", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com"}]}}
