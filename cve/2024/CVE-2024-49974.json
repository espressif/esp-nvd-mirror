In addition, AFAICT each async\nCOPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for a\nlong time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.\n\nAdd a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrent\nbackground COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- this\npatch implements a per-namespace limit.\n\nAn async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded gets\nNFS4ERR_DELAY. The requesting client can choose to send the request\nagain after a delay or fall back to a traditional read/write style\ncopy.\n\nIf there is need to make the mechanism more sophisticated, we can\nvisit that in future patches."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a488ad7745b8f64625c6d3a24ce7e448e83f11b", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aadc3bbea163b6caaaebfdd2b6c4667fbc726752", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4e21431a0db4854b5023cd5af001be557e6c3db", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
