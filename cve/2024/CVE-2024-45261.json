The SID generated for a specific user is not tied to that user itself, which allows other users to potentially use it for authentication. Once an attacker bypasses the application's authentication procedures, they can generate a valid SID, escalate privileges, and gain full control."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/gl-inet/CVE-issues/blob/main/4.0.0/Bypassing%20Login%20Mechanism%20with%20Passwordless%20User%20Login.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
