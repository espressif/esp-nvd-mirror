A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 4.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
