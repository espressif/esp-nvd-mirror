This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 5.2}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/file-manager-advanced/trunk/application/class_fma_main.php#L24", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/file-manager-advanced/trunk/application/class_fma_shortcode.php#L28", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157713/", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ce2b4f93-93a6-480f-a877-ca47bd133bb6?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
