During a window of time when the device is being set up, it uses a default username and password combination of admin/admin with root-level privileges. An attacker can exploit this window to gain unauthorized root access by either modifying the existing admin account or creating a new account with equivalent privileges. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/CVE-2024-31970", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/SRG-834-5", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
