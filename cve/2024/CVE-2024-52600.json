Prior to version 5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets` fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible. This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/0c07c10009a2439c8ee56c8faefd1319dc6e388d", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/400875b20f40e1343699d536a432a6fc284346da", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/4cc2c9bd0f39a93b3fc7e9ef0f12792576fd380d", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-p7f6-8mcm-fwv3", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
