In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()\nhash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not\nsetup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.\n\nA per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly\nassuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an index\nto a next possible CPU."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/28acd531c9a365dac01b32e6bc54aed8c1429bcb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47f9b6e49b422392fb0e348a65eb925103ba1882", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a34acf30b19bc4ee3ba2f1082756ea2604c19138", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
