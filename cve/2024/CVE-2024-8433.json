This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Please note that this was partially fixed in 1.1.0 due to the missing authorization protection that was added."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/themehunk-megamenu-plus/tags/1.1.0/views/admin/item_settings.php?rev=3156084#L196", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/themehunk-megamenu-plus/trunk/inc/megamenu-base.php#L35", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3163871%40themehunk-megamenu-plus&new=3163871%40themehunk-megamenu-plus&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file21", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fc661cfd-6290-4b36-858a-cf2269b5fcf9?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
