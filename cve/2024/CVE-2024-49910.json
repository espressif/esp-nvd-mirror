Previously,\nset_output_gamma was being checked for null, but then it was being\ndereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer\ndereference if set_output_gamma is null.\n\nTo fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before\ndereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma\nbefore the call to set_output_gamma."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8ee900b92b6526cf84275b49a473155ad75c70e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd340acd42c24a3f28dd22fae6bf38662334264c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
