Due to improper or missing access control, low privileged users can use administrative functions of the C-MOR web interface. It was found out that different functions are only available to administrative users. However, access those functions is restricted via the web application user interface and not checked on the server side. Thus, by sending corresponding HTTP requests to the web server of the C-MOR web interface, low privileged users can also use administrative functionality, for instance downloading backup files or changing configuration settings."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://www-syss-de.translate.goog/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-024.txt", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
