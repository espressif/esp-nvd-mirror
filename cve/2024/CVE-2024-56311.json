An attacker can exploit this by luring users into accessing a calendar event's notes, which triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/tree/main/RedCap", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.evms.edu/research/resources_services/redcap/redcap_change_log/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
