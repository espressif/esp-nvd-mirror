Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the\nrisk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog\ntimeout are minimal."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31c254c9cd4b122a10db297124f867107a696d83", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c70e60fbf4bff1123f0e8d5cb1ae71df6164d7f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
