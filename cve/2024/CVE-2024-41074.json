And the request may have not been read yet.\n\nNote that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done\nwith the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request\ncorresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so\nthe read request is never completed and blocks other process.\n\nFix this issue by simply set object to close if its id < 0 in copen."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0845c553db11c84ff53fccd59da11b6d6ece4a60", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f8703fb3482f92edcfd31661857b16fec89c2c0", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/703bea37d13e4ccdafd17ae7c4cb583752ba7663", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c32ee78fbc670e6f90989a45d340748e34cad333", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
