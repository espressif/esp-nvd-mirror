Change the type for both from int to u32, and add an\noverflow check to sysfs to limit the value to S32_MAX.\n\nThe limit of S32_MAX was chosen because the practical limit before this\npatch was S32_MAX (anything larger was an overflow) and thus there are\nno behavioral changes introduced. If the extra bit is needed in the\nfuture, the limit can be raised.\n\nBefore this patch:\n\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo 2147483649 > /sys/class/net/eth4/napi_defer_hard_irqs'\n$ cat /sys/class/net/eth4/napi_defer_hard_irqs\n-2147483647\n\nAfter this patch:\n\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo 2147483649 > /sys/class/net/eth4/napi_defer_hard_irqs'\nbash: line 0: echo: write error: Numerical result out of range\n\nSimilarly, /sys/class/net/XXXXX/tx_queue_len is defined as unsigned:\n\ninclude/linux/netdevice.h:      unsigned int            tx_queue_len;\n\nAnd has an overflow check:\n\ndev_change_tx_queue_len(..., unsigned long new_len):\n\n  if (new_len != (unsigned int)new_len)\n          return -ERANGE;"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/08062af0a52107a243f7608fd972edb54ca5b7f8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5e753b743d3b38a3e10be666c32c5434423d0093", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d694ad8b7e5004df86ecd415cb2320d543723672", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
