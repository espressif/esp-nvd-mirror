However, it still\nwould try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in the\ncurrent pool (if space is available).\n\nThis could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock is\nalready held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI context\nand give up if unsuccessful.\n\nThe documentation is fixed to clearly convey this."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/031e04bdc834cda3b054ef6b698503b2b97e8186", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bfeeeff2c92b9dd261198b601b45bde4c529841", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
