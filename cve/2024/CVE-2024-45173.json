Due to improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges, C-MOR is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The Linux user www-data running the C-MOR web interface can execute some OS commands as root via Sudo without having to enter the root password. These commands, for example, include cp, chown, and chmod, which enable an attacker to modify the system's sudoers file in order to execute all commands with root privileges. Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user www-data to root privileges."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-027.txt", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
