An attacker can request any `route` we want as long as we specify an `operation` that is allowed. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.0 by applying the same access control pattern as in `UI.php` to the `ajax.render.php` page which does not allow arbitrary `routes` to be dispatched. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 4.7}], "cvssMetricV30": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.0", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 4.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-284"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/Combodo/iTop/security/advisories/GHSA-3mxr-8r3j-j2j9", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
