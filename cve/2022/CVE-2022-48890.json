If the I/O\nsubmission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher\nlevel code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like\ncause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which\nis not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer\nmemory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem\ncan arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter\nswiotlb=force.\n\nFix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission\nerror, which frees the bounce buffer memory."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67ff3d0a49f3d445c3922e30a54e03c161da561e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87c71e88f6a6619ffb1ff88f84dff48ef6d57adb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
