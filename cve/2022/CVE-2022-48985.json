If the other thread (for example, from busy_poll) sets\nit to a value >= budget, this thread will continue to run when it should\nstop, and cause memory corruption and panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variable\nbefore napi_complete_done(), so it won't be corrupted by a possible\nconcurrent thread after napi_complete_done().\n\nAlso, add a flag bit to advertise to the NIC firmware: the NAPI work_done\nvariable race is fixed, so the driver is able to reliably support features\nlike busy_poll."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18010ff776fa42340efc428b3ea6d19b3e7c7b21", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6740d8572ccd1bca50d8a1ca2bedc333f50ed5f3", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe50a9bbeb1f042e756c5cfa7708112c944368de", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
