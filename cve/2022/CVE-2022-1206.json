This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files with double extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration will execute the first extension present."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/adrotate/trunk/adrotate-admin-manage.php#L418", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9f92219a-e07e-422d-a9f2-dbe4fbcd5f55?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
