This is\ncausing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has\na different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem\nmanifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.\n\nFix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only\nis passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the\nNETDEV_UNREGISTER event.\n\nAlso included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev\nand related braces."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bea1898f65b9b7096cb4e73e97c83b94718f1fa1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f9daedc3ab8f673e3a9374b91a89fbf1174df469", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faa9bcf700ca1a0d09f92502a6b65d3ce313fb46", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
