However, there's\na race here if two or more harts use the same shadow stack at the same\ntime.\n\nTo solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic var, which\nwill be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when the\nvar is set, it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the var\nis cleared, it means the shadow_stack isn't being used.\n\n[Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]"}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e1864332fbc1b993659eab7974da9fe8bf8c128", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/879fabc5a95401d9bce357e4b1d24ae4a360a81f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac00301adb19df54f2eae1efc4bad7447c0156ce", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
