The attacker would require valid credentials for the device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
