When\ntun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a\nsingle place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never\ndrop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.\n\nFix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as the\ndst+metadata refcount is already 1."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00e6d6c3bc14dfe32824e2c515f0e0f2d6ecf2f1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0be943916d781df2b652793bb2d3ae4f9624c10a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ac84498fbe84a00e7aef185e2bb3e40ce71eca4", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b1087b998e273f07be13dcb5f3ca4c309c7f108", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9eeabdf17fa0ab75381045c867c370f4cc75a613", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a80817adc2a4c1ba26a7aa5f3ed886e4a18dff88", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1ff27d100e2670b03cbfddb9117e5f9fc672540", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fdcb263fa5cda15b8cb24a641fa2718c47605314", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
