If we\nalso have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)\nthen we can find one during the first iteration, close it,\nand go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try\nto destroy also the one we didn't close yet.\n\nFix this by only iterating once."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/241e633cb379c4f332fc1baf2abec95ec840cbeb", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c979f792a2baf6d0f3419587668a1a6eba46a3d2", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f0a6fd1527067da537e9c48390237488719948ed", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
