Source code may be stolen during dev when using version 3.0.0 through 3.15.12 of the webpack builder or version 3.12.2 through 3.152 of the rspack builder and a victim opens a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `window.webpackChunknuxt_app`, the attacker can get the source code. Version 3.15.13 of Nuxt patches this issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-749"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/commit/7eeb910bf4accb1e0193b9178c746f06ad3dd88f", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-4gf7-ff8x-hq99", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}]}}
