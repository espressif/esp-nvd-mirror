This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the\ncurrent interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using\ngeneric_handle_irq.\n\nA previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was\nreplaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However, this change also causes\nthe kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the\ninterrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped\nIRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1263d5f581908602c618c6665e683c4436383a09", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12cc2193f2b9548e8ea5fbce8201b44158222edf", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18eb77c75ed01439f96ae5c0f33461eb5134b907", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e02059dc91068bc5017b8546f9ec3b930f6d6a6", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62957f58ab3aa7fa792dc6ff3575624062539a4d", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
