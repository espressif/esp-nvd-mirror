However if\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is an uncommon and exotic scenario, then\nwe fallthrough and call cache_state() which will dereference the error\npointer, resulting in an invalid memory access.\n\nSo jump to the 'out' label after calling extent_io_tree_panic(), it also\nmakes the code more clear besides dealing with the exotic scenario where\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3bf179e36da917c5d9bec71c714573ed1649b7c1", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/58c50f45e1821a04d61b62514f9bd34afe67c622", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d9d32088e304e2bc444a3087cab0bbbd9951866", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
