Further exploitation (e.g., bypassing file permission checking or remote kernel code execution) is potentially possible, though this has not been demonstrated.  In particular, release kernels are compiled with stack protection enabled, and some instances of the overflow are caught by this mechanism, causing a panic."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secteam@freebsd.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-121"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-25:02.fs.asc", "source": "secteam@freebsd.org"}]}}
