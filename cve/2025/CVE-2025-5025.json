Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3, when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-5025.html", "source": "2499f714-1537-4658-8207-48ae4bb9eae9"}, {"url": "https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-5025.json", "source": "2499f714-1537-4658-8207-48ae4bb9eae9"}, {"url": "https://hackerone.com/reports/3153497", "source": "2499f714-1537-4658-8207-48ae4bb9eae9"}]}}
