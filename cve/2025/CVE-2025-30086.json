The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-h27m-3qw8-3pw8", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://goharbor.io/blog/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
