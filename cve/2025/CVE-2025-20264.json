An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of specific commands to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify a limited number of system settings, including some that would result in a system restart. In single-node Cisco ISE deployments, devices that are not authenticated to the network will not be able to authenticate until the Cisco ISE system comes back online.&nbsp;"}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "psirt@cisco.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "psirt@cisco.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-285"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-auth-bypass-mVfKVQAU", "source": "psirt@cisco.com"}]}}
