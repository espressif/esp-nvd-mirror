By creating a trailing-dot folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD). The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been acknowledged by the vendor."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/PotatoHamm/Nero-Productline-Vulnerability", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
