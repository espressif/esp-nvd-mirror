DTs for other SoCs\nindeed specify 4 bytes, so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.\n\nFortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem\ncell, in bytes, so we can use that information to only access the valid\nportion of the data.\nTo cover multiple cell sizes, use memcpy() to copy the information into a\nzeroed u32 buffer, then also make sure we always read the data in little\nendian fashion, as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14c8a418159e541d70dbf8fc71225d1623beaf0f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/40bf7f560ca4c2468d518cebf14561bc864f58f8", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dba5a1f963cf781c0b60f4b7f07465a6c687c27e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
