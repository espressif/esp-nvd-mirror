The ping6.asp page submits user input to the /boaform/formPing6 endpoint via the pingAddr parameter, which is not properly sanitized. An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by injecting arbitrary system commands, which are executed by the underlying operating system with root privileges. The router uses the Boa web server (version 0.93.15) to handle the request. Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise and unauthorized control of the network device."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/Jorge2Rubio/CVEs/blob/main/CVE-2025-56498.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://prolink2u.com/products/pgn6401v", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
