A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Classic Web Client due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content in ICS files. When a user views an e-mail message containing a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details> tag. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the victim's account, including e-mail redirection and data exfiltration."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.13#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.1.5#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P44#Security_Fixes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
