This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the whitelist_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the default role option that can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is only exploitable on multisite instances."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-352"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpfront-user-role-editor/trunk/includes/users/class-user-profile.php#L104", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpfront-user-role-editor/trunk/includes/users/class-user-profile.php#L399", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3266542/#file142", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfront-user-role-editor/#developers", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/efc7ad9f-714e-474c-87e8-ecbbdfabd550?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
