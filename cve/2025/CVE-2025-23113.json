It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "cve@mitre.org", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 1.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "cve@mitre.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-352"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/blob/main/RedCap/CVE_XXX/README.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
