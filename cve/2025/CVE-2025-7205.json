This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP worker-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally, they need to trick an administrator into visiting the legacy version of the site."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 2.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@wordfence.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/give/trunk/src/API/REST/V3/Routes/Donors/DonorNotesController.php#51", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3333090/give", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/39e501d8-88a0-4625-aeb0-aa33fc89a8d4?source=cve", "source": "security@wordfence.com"}]}}
