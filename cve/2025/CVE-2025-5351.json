The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 2.5}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "secalert@redhat.com", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-415"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5351", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2369367", "source": "secalert@redhat.com"}]}}
