This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which\ncrashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with\nearlycon).\n\nIn order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get\na 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter\nof mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing\nmtk_eint_do_init()'s dependency on any particular 'struct mtk_pinctrl'."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c9977b263475373b31bbf86af94a5c9ae2be42c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ebe21ede792cef851847648962c363cac67d17f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
