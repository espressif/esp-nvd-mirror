In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn't exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 4.7}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/blob/v4.4.5/tools/attach/libs/attach.lib.php#L660", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j", "source": "134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"}]}}
