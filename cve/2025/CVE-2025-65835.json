The onReceive implementation accesses Intent.EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT without checking for null. If a broadcast is sent with extras present but without EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT, the code dereferences a null value and throws a NullPointerException. Because the receiver is exported and performs no permission or caller validation, any local application on the device can send crafted ACTION_SEND broadcasts to this component and repeatedly crash the host application, resulting in a local, unauthenticated application-level denial of service for any app that includes the plugin."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@lcrawfqrd/local-dos-via-exported-receivers-f6b1da10d3b7", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
