This prevents\nsubsequent probe attempts from succeeding, even if the issue is\ncorrected, unless the device is released. Additionally, cleanup is also\nneeded in the less likely case of platform_device_register_full()\nfailure.\n\nBesides, a consistent memory leak in lookup_table->dev_id was spotted\nusing kmemleak by toggling the live state between 0 and 1 with a correct\nlookup table.\n\nIntroduce gpio_virtuser_remove_lookup_table() as the counterpart to the\nexisting gpio_virtuser_make_lookup_table() and call it from all\nnecessary points to ensure proper cleanup."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a619cba8c69c434258ff4101d463322cd63e1bdc", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d72d0126b1f6981f6ce8b4247305f359958c11b5", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
