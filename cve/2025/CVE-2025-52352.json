However, the sign-up API endpoint remains publicly accessible and functional, allowing unauthenticated users to register accounts via APIs even when the feature is disabled. This leads to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to admin portals, violating intended access controls."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/Shubhangborkar/aikaan-vulnerabilities/blob/main/cve4-signup-api-bypass.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.aikaan.io", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
