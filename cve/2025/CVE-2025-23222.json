Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "cve@mitre.org", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.5, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "cve@mitre.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-940"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1229918", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://security.opensuse.org/2025/01/24/dde-api-proxy-privilege-escalation.html", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/24/3", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
