And indeed\nit will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.\n\nThen enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer. It will crash the kernel right\naway or load some junk which may look like a link TRB and cause the real\nlink TRB to be replaced with a NOOP. This wouldn't end well.\n\nUse a functionally equivalent test which doesn't dereference the pointer\nand always gives correct result.\n\nSomething has crashed my machine twice in recent days while playing with\nan Etron HC, and a control transfer stress test ran for confirmation has\njust crashed it again. The same test passes with this patch applied."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0624e29c595b05e7a0e6d1c368f0a05799928e30", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/142273a49f2c315eabdbdf5a71c15e479b75ca91", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ea050da5562af9b930d17cbbe9632d30f5df43a", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bce3055b08e303e28a8751f6073066f5c33a0744", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
