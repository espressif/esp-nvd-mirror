However the origin was not correctly inferred in some cases. When combined with an open redirector vulnerability on a trusted site, this could allow a malicious site to initiate a download whose origin in the file select dialog appears as the trusted site which initiated the redirect."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2888770", "source": "support@hackerone.com"}]}}
