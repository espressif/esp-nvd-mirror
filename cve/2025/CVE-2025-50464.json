The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8, allocated 8 bytes) without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed, the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/lafdrew/IOT/blob/main/iptime_nas_1.5.04/Buffer-Overflow-in-upload-cgi-of-iptime-nas-1-5-04.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://lafdrew.github.io/2025/04/25/Buffer-Overflow-in-upload-cgi-of-iptime-nas-1-5-04/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
