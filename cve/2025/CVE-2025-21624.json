Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/893bfb0f1236c4a59b5e2843ab8d27a1e491b12b", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc", "source": "134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"}]}}
