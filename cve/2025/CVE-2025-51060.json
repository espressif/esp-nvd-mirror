An attacker can use DeviceIoControl with the unvalidated parameters 0x9C402440 and 0x9C402444 as IoControlCodes to perform RDMSR and WRMSR, respectively. Through this process, the attacker can modify MSR_LSTAR and hook KiSystemCall64. Afterward, using Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), the attacker can manipulate the stack with pre-prepared gadgets, disable the SMAP flag in the CR4 register, and execute a user-mode syscall handler in the kernel context. It has not been confirmed whether this works on 32-bit Windows, but it functions on 64-bit Windows if the core isolation feature is either absent or disabled."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "http://cpuid.com", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://cpuzsys.com", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/ZiaLib/Zmsr", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
