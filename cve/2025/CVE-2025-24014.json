A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}, "exploitabilityScore": 0.8, "impactScore": 3.4}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security-advisories@github.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-787"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d1bed5eccdbb46a26b8a484f5e9163c40e63919", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-j3g9-wg22-v955", "source": "security-advisories@github.com"}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/4", "source": "af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/21/1", "source": "af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"}]}}
