So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their \nown server. Still, a situation can happen where an admin not \nknowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into \nwriting the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Convict: before 6.2.4."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@mozilla.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1321"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict/issues/410", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict/security/advisories/GHSA-4jrm-c32x-w4jf", "source": "security@mozilla.org"}]}}
