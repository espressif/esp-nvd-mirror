This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model that fails to restrict file watching through the fs.watchFile API. As a result, malicious actors can monitor files that they do not have explicit read access to.\n\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2023-security-releases", "source": "support@hackerone.com"}]}}
