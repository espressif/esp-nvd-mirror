This vulnerability exclusively affects Node.js users employing the permission model mechanism.\n\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2023-security-releases", "source": "support@hackerone.com"}]}}
