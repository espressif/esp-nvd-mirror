This allows an attacker to censor content by generating many Sybil peers whose peer IDs have a small distance from the content ID, thus hijacking the content resolution process."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12212", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
