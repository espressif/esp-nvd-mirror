The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when\niovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 will\noverflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is\nupdated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make the\nallocation successful.\n\nThis issue occurs in the following two situations:\n1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing\niova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. For\nexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,\nand the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The\nfollowing is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than\niovad->cached_node.\n\nExample log as follows:\n[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nstart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00\n[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nsuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff\n\n2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain\nis deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,\nand then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can\nbe allocated in the domain.\n\nAfter judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1\nto fix the overflow issue."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/61cbf790e7329ed78877560be7136f0b911bba7f", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c929a230c84441e400c32e7b7b4ab763711fb63e", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dcdb3ba7e2a8caae7bfefd603bc22fd0ce9a389c", "source": "416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}}
