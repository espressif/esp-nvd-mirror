This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the function and its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block.  A similar problem was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assigned CVE-2023-40400."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "security@tcpdump.org", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 0.8, "impactScore": 3.6}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@tcpdump.org", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-415"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/262e4f34979872d822ccedf9f318ed89c4d31c03", "source": "security@tcpdump.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/2aa69b04d8173b18a0e3492e0c8f2f7fabdf642d", "source": "security@tcpdump.org"}]}}
