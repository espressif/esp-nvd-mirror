The attacker obtains the ability to modify files.db, and that can be used to reach a stack-based buffer overflow in minidlna-1.1.2/upnpsoap.c. Exploitation requires that a USB flash drive is connected to the router (customers often do this to make a \\\\192.168.0.1 share available on their local network)."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/stevenseeley/0822b66e375cd44ecaee3f047962db62", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.tecsecurity.io/blog/tp-link_ax1800", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
